      </p>
      <p>IP address used
      </p>
      <p>The server log files are stored for a maximum of 21 days and then deleted. The data is stored for security reasons in order to be able to investigate attacks on our platform and other cases of misuse. If data must be retained for evidentiary purposes, it will not be deleted until the incident has been finally resolved.
